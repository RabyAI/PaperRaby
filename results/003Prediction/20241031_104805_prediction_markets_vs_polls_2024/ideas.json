        "Title": "Comparative Analysis: Prediction Markets vs Traditional Polling in the 2024 US Presidential Election",
        "Experiment": "Design a systematic study that tracks and compares prediction market prices (from platforms like PredictIt) with traditional polling data (from established polling organizations) over the election cycle. Analyze key metrics including: price/probability movements after major events, polling shifts, accuracy relative to interim election results (e.g. primaries), volatility patterns, and the correlation between both prediction methods. Implement time-series analysis to measure lead-lag relationships between markets and polls.",
