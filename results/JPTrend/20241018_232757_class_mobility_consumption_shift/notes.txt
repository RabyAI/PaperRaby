# Title: The Influence of Class Mobility on Material vs. Spiritual Consumption Trends in Japan
# Experiment description: We will analyze year-over-year changes in class percentages to quantify class mobility. We'll create mobility indices for each class, with positive values indicating upward mobility and negative values indicating downward mobility. We'll then correlate these mobility indices with changes in material and spiritual consumption percentages. Special attention will be given to the dynamics within the middle class by separately analyzing upper and lower middle class mobility. We'll use time series analysis and multiple regression to identify how class mobility patterns relate to shifts in consumption preferences over the given time period.

## Plot Descriptions

1. Class Percentages Over Time (class_percentages.png):
This plot illustrates the evolution of class distribution in Japan from 1975 to 2015. It shows four lines representing the percentages of Rich, Upper Middle, Lower Middle, and Poor classes over time. Key observations:
- The Rich class shows a steady increase from about 44.5% in 1975 to 73.7% in 2015.
- The Upper Middle class also increases, but at a slower rate, from 25.4% to 39.1%.
- The Lower Middle class remains relatively stable, slightly decreasing from 20.9% to 19.9%.
- The Poor class shows a significant decrease from 17.2% to 10%.
This visualization helps identify trends in class mobility and the overall shift towards higher economic classes in Japan during this period.

2. Material vs Spiritual Consumption Trends (consumption_trends.png):
This graph compares the trends in material and spiritual consumption in Japan from 1975 to 2015. Key insights:
- Material consumption shows a steady decline from 42% in 1975 to 22% in 2015.
- Spiritual consumption demonstrates a consistent increase from 36% in 1975 to 58% in 2015.
- The lines cross around 1981-1982, indicating a shift in societal values from material to spiritual consumption.
This plot is crucial for understanding the changing consumption patterns in Japan and how they relate to class mobility and economic development.

3. Class Mobility Indices Over Time (class_mobility.png):
This plot displays the mobility indices for each class over time, calculated as the year-over-year change in class percentages. Positive values indicate upward mobility, while negative values suggest downward mobility. Key observations:
- The Rich class mobility index is consistently positive, indicating continuous growth of this class.
- Upper Middle class mobility is also positive but less pronounced than the Rich class.
- Lower Middle class mobility is slightly negative, showing a gradual decline.
- Poor class mobility is consistently negative, reflecting a decreasing proportion of the population in this class.
This visualization is essential for understanding the dynamics of class movement in Japan, highlighting which classes are expanding or contracting over time.

These plots collectively provide a comprehensive view of the relationship between class mobility and consumption trends in Japan from 1975 to 2015. They illustrate the gradual shift towards higher economic classes, the transition from material to spiritual consumption, and the specific mobility patterns of each class. This information is crucial for analyzing the socioeconomic changes in Japan during this period and their potential causes and effects.
