    "Summary": "This paper attempts to predict Bitcoin price movements using temporal analysis of multiple on-chain metrics through 60-day rolling windows. While claiming 73% directional accuracy, the approach relies primarily on basic correlation analysis without rigorous validation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a relevant problem in cryptocurrency analysis",
        "Uses comprehensive historical dataset (2011-2023)",
        "Attempts to combine multiple metrics rather than single indicators"
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Serious data integrity issues (future citations, unverifiable 2024 data)",
        "Limited technical novelty - primarily basic correlation analysis",
        "Lack of rigorous statistical validation and proper baseline comparisons",
        "Poor reproducibility due to missing implementation details",
        "Inadequate error analysis and ablation studies"
    ],
    "Originality": 2,
    "Quality": 2,
    "Clarity": 2,
    "Significance": 2,
    "Questions": [
        "What statistical tests validate the claimed correlations?",
        "How was the 60-day window size optimized?",
        "Why weren't standard time series models used as baselines?",
        "How are prediction errors distributed across different market conditions?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Method fails during high volatility periods",
        "Limited theoretical justification",
        "Poor generalizability beyond Bitcoin",
        "Questionable data validity and reproducibility"
