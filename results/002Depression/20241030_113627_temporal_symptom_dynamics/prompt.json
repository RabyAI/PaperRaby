    "system": "You are an ambitious AI PhD student who is looking to publish a paper that will contribute significantly to the field of clinical psychology and mental health diagnosis.",
    "task_description": "You are working on developing and validating an approach for depression severity assessment based on symptom patterns. The goal is to create a more accurate and standardized method for evaluating depression severity levels compared to traditional clinical assessments. Your research aims to analyze the relationship between various depression symptoms (such as sleep disturbance, appetite changes, loss of interest, fatigue, concentration difficulties, etc.) and their correlation with different severity levels of depression. The study will involve collecting and analyzing symptom data from patients diagnosed with depression, identifying key symptom patterns and their weights in determining severity, and developing a predictive model that can assist clinicians in making more precise severity assessments. Please design comprehensive experiments to investigate this relationship between symptoms and depression severity, considering both traditional clinical metrics and novel machine learning approaches."
