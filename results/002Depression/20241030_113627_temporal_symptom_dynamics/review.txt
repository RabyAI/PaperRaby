    "Summary": "This paper presents a temporal network analysis approach for studying depression symptom dynamics, combining high-frequency longitudinal data collection (thrice-weekly over 6 weeks) with weighted network analysis to quantify relationships between 28 depression symptoms. The analysis reveals a clear symptom hierarchy with energy loss and sadness as dominant network hubs.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Novel technical framework combining temporal dynamics with weighted network analysis",
        "Rigorous mathematical formalization of symptom relationships through centrality measures",
        "Efficient data collection protocol balancing temporal resolution with feasibility",
        "Clear visualization and quantification of symptom hierarchies",
        "Open-source implementation enabling reproducibility"
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Critical lack of validation against clinical outcomes",
        "No information provided about sample size or participant demographics",
        "Sensitivity analysis of network parameters not conducted",
        "Causal relationships between symptoms not addressed",
        "Six-week window may be insufficient for capturing long-term patterns"

    "Questions": [
        "What was the sample size and demographic composition?",

        "Were any validation studies conducted against clinical outcomes?",
        "How was the network analysis validated for statistical significance?",
        "What methods were used to ensure data quality and handle missing values?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Results not validated against clinical outcomes",
        "Network analysis cannot establish causal relationships",
        "Limited temporal window may miss longer-term patterns",
        "Network metrics sensitive to sampling parameters"
