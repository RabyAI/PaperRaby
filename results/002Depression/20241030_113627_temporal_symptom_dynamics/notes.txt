# Title: Temporal Dynamics of Depression Symptoms: A Weighted Network Approach to Severity Assessment
# Experiment description: Use an existing survey platform for symptom logging three times a week over 6 weeks. Apply time series analysis and dynamic network modeling, incorporating symptom centrality weights. Compare temporal patterns with static assessments in predicting clinically evaluated depression severity.

Description: Baseline assessment of depression symptom centrality measures.

### Visualization Analysis

#### Bar Plot (centrality_barplot_0.png)
The bar plot provides a comprehensive visualization of all 28 depression symptoms, ranked by their node strength centrality values. This plot reveals several key insights:

1. Primary Symptoms: The most central symptoms are energy loss (1.25), sadness (1.20), and sympathetic arousal (1.15), suggesting these are the most interconnected symptoms in the depression network.
2. Core Cluster: A notable cluster of high-centrality symptoms (>1.0) includes interest loss, pleasure loss, and concentration problems, representing core depression manifestations.
3. Distribution Pattern: The centrality values show a gradual decline from 1.25 to 0.01, with steeper drops in the middle range.
4. Peripheral Symptoms: The least central symptoms (centrality <0.05) include gastrointestinal problems, diurnal variation, and mood quality, suggesting these may be more peripheral or secondary symptoms.

#### Network Plot (network_plot_0.png)
The network visualization focuses on the top 10 most central symptoms, using a radial layout to illustrate their relationships:

1. Central Hub: The plot places the most central symptoms (energy loss, sadness, sympathetic arousal) with thicker connecting lines, indicating their stronger influence in the network.
2. Connectivity Pattern: Line thickness corresponds to centrality values, visually emphasizing the hierarchical importance of symptoms.
3. Spatial Organization: The circular arrangement helps identify natural clusters of related symptoms (e.g., the cluster of interest/pleasure loss symptoms).
4. Clinical Implications: This visualization is particularly useful for clinicians as it quickly identifies the most influential symptoms that might be primary targets for intervention.

Key Findings:
- The analysis reveals a clear hierarchy of symptom importance in depression presentation
- Physical symptoms (energy loss) and emotional symptoms (sadness) show the highest centrality
- Sleep-related symptoms show moderate centrality, distributed across the network
- Vegetative symptoms generally show lower centrality values
- The network structure suggests potential intervention points for treatment planning

Methodological Notes:
- Node strength centrality values range from 0.01 to 1.25
- Top 10 symptoms account for approximately 42% of total network centrality
- The visualization approach effectively captures both the magnitude and relative importance of symptoms
