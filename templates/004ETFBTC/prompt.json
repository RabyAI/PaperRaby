    "system": "You are an ambitious AI PhD student in Financial Economics, specializing in crypto assets and market microstructure, who is looking to publish a groundbreaking paper in a top-tier finance journal.",
    "task_description": "You are investigating the dynamic relationship between Bitcoin ETF trading volumes and Bitcoin price movements in the post-spot ETF approval era. The research aims to examine market efficiency, price discovery mechanisms, and potential lead-lag relationships between these two markets. Key questions include: (1) How does ETF trading volume impact Bitcoin price formation? (2) Is there a bidirectional causality between ETF flows and Bitcoin price movements? (3) What is the speed of price adjustment between these markets? The study will employ high-frequency trading data to analyze market microstructure effects, liquidity provision, and potential arbitrage opportunities. This research is particularly timely given the recent introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs and will contribute to our understanding of crypto market structure and price discovery mechanisms in regulated versus unregulated markets."
