        "Experiment": "We will analyze year-over-year changes in class percentages to quantify class mobility. We'll create mobility indices for each class, with positive values indicating upward mobility and negative values indicating downward mobility. We'll then correlate these mobility indices with changes in material and spiritual consumption percentages. Special attention will be given to the dynamics within the middle class by separately analyzing upper and lower middle class mobility. We'll use time series analysis and multiple regression to identify how class mobility patterns relate to shifts in consumption preferences over the given time period.",
