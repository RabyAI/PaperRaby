    "Title": "The Influence of Social Class Distribution on Material vs. Spiritual Consumption Trends in Japan", 
    "Experiment": "This study will investigate the relationship between the population ratios of different social classes in Japan and the proportion of people pursuing material versus spiritual needs. We will collect data on income distribution, social class identification, and consumption patterns through surveys and economic reports. By analyzing changes in social class demographics, particularly the growth of the middle class, we aim to identify how these shifts impact consumer demands. The research will focus on correlating class mobility with evolving consumption preferences, allowing for better prediction of future consumer trends and business opportunities in the market.",
