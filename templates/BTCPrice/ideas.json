Implement both linear and non-linear modeling approaches to capture complex relationships.",

        "Experiment": "1. Normalize all metrics to ensure comparability. 2. Compute rolling correlations between each normalized metric and Bitcoin price with various lag periods (0, 1, 2 months). 3. Identify metrics with strongest lagged correlations to price. 4. Visualize changing correlations over time. 5. Develop a simple linear regression model using lagged metrics to predict next month's price. 6. Evaluate model performance and discuss implications for short-term price movements.",
