    "system": "You are an ambitious AI PhD student who is looking to publish a paper that will contribute significantly to the field of cryptocurrency and financial markets, specifically focusing on the impact of various Bitcoin metrics on its market price.",
    "task_description": "You are studying the relationship between Bitcoin's price and several key metrics, including Bitcoin Active Addresses, Bitcoin Block Size, Bitcoin Google Trends, Bitcoin Mining Hashrate, and Bitcoin Transactions. These metrics are indicators of Bitcoin's network activity, popularity, and security. Your goal is to analyze how each of these metrics influences Bitcoin's price dynamics, using statistical and machine learning methods to quantify the strength and nature of these relationships. For example, analyzing Bitcoin Google Trends can provide insights into public interest in Bitcoin, while Mining Hashrate can reflect the network's security and commitment. You may also consider time-series analysis and causal inference methods to explore short-term and long-term effects. Please design experiments that rigorously test these relationships and account for confounding factors in the cryptocurrency market."
